            "Discp":"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of machine learning model used for generating new data that mimics existing data. They consist of two neural networks—a generator that creates new samples and a discriminator that evaluates them. Through a competitive process, the generator improves its output while the discriminator enhances its ability to distinguish real from fake data. GANs are widely used in applications like image generation, video creation, and enhancing data diversity, making them a powerful tool in the field of artificial intelligence.",

Here’s a concise overview: \n# Components Generator: \n\tThis neural network creates synthetic images from random noise or structured input (like a class label). Its goal is to produce images that are visually indistinguishable from real ones.\n#Discriminator:\n\t This neural network evaluates images to determine whether they are real (from the training set) or fake (produced by the generator). It provides feedback to the generator to improve its outputs.\n\n#Process :\n\tTraining: The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a zero-sum game. The generator improves by trying to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator improves by getting better at detecting fakes.\n# Objective:\n\tThe generator aims to minimize the difference between generated images and real images, while the discriminator aims to maximize its ability to correctly classify real and fake images."
